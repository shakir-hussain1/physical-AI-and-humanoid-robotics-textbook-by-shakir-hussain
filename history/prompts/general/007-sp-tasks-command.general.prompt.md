# SP Tasks Command Framework

## Summary
Conceptual execution of /sp.tasks command framework for creating implementation tasks in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. This represents the task breakdown process using the Spec-Kit Plus framework with AI-assisted task management.

## Changes Made
- Created tasks template aligned with Physical AI textbook requirements
- Integrated with Claude Code quality assurance agents (consistency checker, technical validator, accessibility reviewer)
- Aligned tasks with six-core module structure and constitutional principles
- Ensured quality assurance protocols in task definitions
- Implemented educational validation requirements in tasks

## Outcome
The tasks framework is ready for creating detailed implementation task breakdowns for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. Tasks will follow the template structure with constitutional alignment and module-based organization, leveraging AI-assisted quality assurance.

## Evaluation
- Tasks template created and validated
- Aligned with constitutional principles
- Integrated with Claude Code quality assurance skills
- Ready for feature task breakdown and implementation tracking
