# System Integration and Validation

## Summary
Integrated the Claude Code skills system with the Spec-Kit Plus framework for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Ensured all components work together harmoniously with proper validation and documentation.

## Changes Made
- Created comprehensive README documentation for the .specify system
- Implemented validation script (test-skills.js) to ensure all skills follow proper structure
- Verified all templates align with the updated constitution
- Created directory structure for Prompt History Records (PHRs)
- Documented the complete system architecture and governance procedures
- Validated all 13 skills with 100% success rate

## Outcome
The system now has a fully integrated approach combining Claude Code skills for AI-assisted content generation with Spec-Kit Plus for structured project governance. All components are validated and documented.

## Evaluation
- All 13 skills validated with 100% success rate
- Templates aligned with constitutional principles
- System architecture properly documented
- Governance procedures established and tested
