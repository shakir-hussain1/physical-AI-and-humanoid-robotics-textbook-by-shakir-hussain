# SP Plan Command Framework

## Summary
Conceptual execution of /sp.plan command framework for creating implementation plans in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. This represents the planning process using the Spec-Kit Plus framework with AI-assisted planning capabilities.

## Changes Made
- Created plan template aligned with Physical AI textbook requirements
- Integrated with Claude Code planning agents (module architect, prerequisite analyzer, progression optimizer)
- Aligned plans with six-core module structure and constitutional principles
- Ensured technical excellence and educational pedagogy in planning process
- Implemented module-based structure considerations in planning

## Outcome
The planning framework is ready for creating detailed implementation plans for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. Plans will follow the template structure with constitutional alignment and module-based organization, leveraging AI-assisted planning agents.

## Evaluation
- Planning template created and validated
- Aligned with constitutional principles
- Integrated with Claude Code planning skills
- Ready for feature planning and architectural design
