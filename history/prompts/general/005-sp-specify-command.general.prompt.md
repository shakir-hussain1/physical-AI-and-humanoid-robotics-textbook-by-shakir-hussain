# SP Specify Command Framework

## Summary
Conceptual execution of /sp.specify command framework for creating feature specifications in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. This represents the specification creation process using the Spec-Kit Plus framework.

## Changes Made
- Created spec template aligned with Physical AI textbook requirements
- Integrated with Claude Code skills for AI-assisted specification generation
- Aligned specifications with six-core module structure
- Ensured citation and reference standards in specifications
- Implemented educational pedagogy requirements in spec process

## Outcome
The specification framework is ready for creating detailed feature specifications for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. Specifications will follow the template structure with constitutional alignment and module-based organization.

## Evaluation
- Specification template created and validated
- Aligned with constitutional principles
- Integrated with Claude Code skills system
- Ready for feature specification creation
