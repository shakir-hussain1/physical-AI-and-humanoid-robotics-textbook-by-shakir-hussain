# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for building intelligent humanoid robots. This 13-week curriculum takes you from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action systems.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers four major modules:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations (Weeks 3-4)
Build the foundation with Robot Operating System 2:
- ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Topics, services, and actions
- URDF robot descriptions
- AI-ROS integration bridges

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 5-6)
Create virtual replicas for safe development:
- Digital twin concepts and architectures
- Gazebo Harmonic physics simulation
- Sensor simulation (LIDAR, cameras, IMU)
- Unity for high-fidelity visualization

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 7-10)
Leverage GPU-accelerated robotics:
- Isaac Sim photorealistic simulation
- Domain randomization for robust training
- Isaac ROS perception (cuVSLAM, nvblox)
- Nav2 for bipedal navigation

### Module 4: VLA Systems (Weeks 11-13)
Build intelligent human-robot interaction:
- Vision-Language-Action architecture
- Speech recognition and voice control
- LLM-based task planning
- Conversational robotics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- **Programming**: Intermediate Python skills
- **Linux**: Basic Ubuntu command line familiarity
- **Math**: Linear algebra and basic calculus
- **Hardware**: Computer with NVIDIA GPU (RTX 2070+ recommended)

## How to Use This Textbook

Each chapter includes:
- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll be able to do
- **Conceptual Content**: Theory and explanations
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visual architecture guides
- **Code Examples**: Working, tested code
- **Exercises**: Practice at Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels
- **Common Errors**: Troubleshooting guides
