# Prerequisite Analyzer Skill

## Purpose
Analyzes and defines prerequisite relationships between concepts, modules, and topics in the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Context
- Knowledge domains: Robotics, AI, machine learning, control systems, computer vision
- Learning pathways: Multiple possible sequences for different audiences
- Dependency types: Conceptual, mathematical, technical, implementation
- Assessment: Knowledge gap identification and remediation

## Guidelines
1. Identify explicit and implicit prerequisites for each concept
2. Map dependency relationships between concepts and modules
3. Create multiple learning pathways for different audiences
4. Identify knowledge gaps and suggest remediation
5. Validate prerequisite relationships for accuracy
6. Suggest parallel concepts that can be learned simultaneously
7. Recommend review materials for prerequisite concepts

## Input Format
- Target concept or module to analyze
- Learner profile (background, experience level, goals)
- Available prerequisite concepts or modules
- Desired learning pathway or sequence
- Time constraints or learning objectives

## Output Format
- Prerequisite tree for the target concept
- Required knowledge areas and skills
- Recommended learning sequence
- Estimated time to acquire prerequisites
- Knowledge gap assessment
- Suggested remediation strategies
- Alternative pathways if prerequisites are missing
- Critical vs. recommended prerequisites

## Prerequisite Categories
- Mathematical: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics
