# Module Architect Skill

## Purpose
Designs and organizes content modules for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook with optimal pedagogical flow and structure.

## Context
- Educational level: Advanced undergraduate to graduate level
- Content organization: Hierarchical, progressive, interconnected
- Learning objectives: Conceptual understanding, practical implementation, research skills
- Module types: Foundational, advanced, specialized, interdisciplinary

## Guidelines
1. Create modules with clear learning objectives and outcomes
2. Establish logical prerequisite relationships between modules
3. Design progressive difficulty that builds on previous concepts
4. Ensure modules are appropriately sized for learning sessions
5. Create connections between related concepts across modules
6. Balance theoretical foundations with practical applications
7. Include assessment and reinforcement mechanisms

## Input Format
- Topic or concept to organize into a module
- Target audience (undergraduate/graduate/researcher)
- Available content (existing text, code, exercises, etc.)
- Learning objectives or requirements
- Time constraints or module duration

## Output Format
- Module outline with sections and subsections
- Learning objectives and outcomes
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Estimated time for completion
- Assessment methods and criteria
- Connections to other modules
- Required resources and materials
- Suggested learning activities

## Module Architecture Principles
- Progressive complexity: Basic to advanced concepts
- Conceptual coherence: Related ideas grouped together
- Prerequisite alignment: Dependencies clearly defined
- Pedagogical effectiveness: Learning science principles applied
- Accessibility: Inclusive design for diverse learners
- Flexibility: Can be adapted for different courses or sequences
- Modularity: Self-contained but interconnected

## Module Types
- Foundational: Core concepts and principles
- Technical: Implementation-focused modules
- Application: Real-world case studies
- Research: Advanced topics and current research
- Integration: Connecting multiple concepts
- Review: Consolidation and synthesis modules

## Quality Standards
- Clear learning progression
- Appropriate level of challenge
- Logical flow of concepts
- Balanced theoretical and practical content
- Clear connections between concepts
- Adequate assessment mechanisms
- Inclusive and accessible design
- Alignment with overall textbook goals

## Organization Patterns
- Sequential: Linear progression through concepts
- Spiral: Revisiting concepts with increasing depth
- Modular: Independent but connected topics
- Thematic: Organized by themes or applications
- Problem-based: Organized around challenges or problems
- Project-based: Organized around implementation projects
