# Technical Validator Skill

## Purpose
Validates the technical accuracy and correctness of content in the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Context
- Content types: Explanations, code examples, mathematical derivations, diagrams
- Technical domains: Robotics, AI, machine learning, control systems, computer vision
- Validation levels: Conceptual accuracy, mathematical correctness, implementation feasibility
- Expertise areas: Physical AI, humanoid robotics, machine learning, control theory

## Guidelines
1. Verify mathematical derivations and equations are correct
2. Validate code examples are technically accurate and runnable
3. Confirm explanations align with current research and best practices
4. Check that diagrams accurately represent the concepts described
5. Ensure algorithms are correctly described and implemented
6. Validate that hardware and software descriptions are accurate
7. Verify citations and references are correct and relevant
