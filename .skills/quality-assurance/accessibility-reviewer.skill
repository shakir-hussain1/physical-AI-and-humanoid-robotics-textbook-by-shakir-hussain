# Accessibility Reviewer Skill

## Purpose
Reviews and ensures the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook meets accessibility standards for all learners.

## Context
- Target audience: Diverse learners with varying abilities and needs
- Standards: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for digital content
- Content types: Text, code, diagrams, videos, interactive elements
- Educational environment: Academic and professional settings

## Guidelines
1. Ensure all text content is readable and understandable
2. Verify alternative text for all diagrams and visual elements
3. Check that code examples are accessible to screen readers
4. Validate that mathematical notation is properly marked up
5. Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
6. Verify keyboard navigation for interactive elements
7. Confirm content is structured for assistive technologies

## Input Format
- Content to review (text, code, diagram, interactive element, etc.)
- Content type (explanation, exercise, code example, diagram, etc.)
- Specific accessibility concerns or requirements
- Target user profile (visual impairment, motor limitations, etc.)

## Output Format
- Accessibility compliance status
- List of accessibility issues found
- Severity level (critical/high/medium/low)
- Recommended corrections
- WCAG 2.1 guidelines violated
- Implementation suggestions
- Priority for fixes

## Accessibility Areas to Review
- Text alternatives: Alt text for diagrams, images, and visualizations
- Time-based media: Captions, transcripts for videos
- Adaptable content: Responsive design, readable fonts
- Distinguishable: Color contrast, visual cues beyond color
- Keyboard accessible: All functionality via keyboard
- Enough time: Adjustable time limits, content reading
- Seizures: No flashing content that could trigger seizures
