# Consistency Checker Skill

## Purpose
Ensures consistency in terminology, style, notation, and presentation throughout the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Context
- Content types: Text explanations, code examples, diagrams, exercises
- Consistency areas: Terminology, mathematical notation, formatting, style
- Quality standards: Academic rigor, accessibility, pedagogical effectiveness
- Integration: Automated checks with manual verification for complex issues

## Guidelines
1. Verify consistent use of terminology across all modules
2. Check mathematical notation consistency and clarity
3. Ensure formatting consistency (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
4. Validate style consistency (tone, voice, technical depth)
5. Verify consistent referencing and citation style
6. Check for consistent use of diagrams and visual elements
7. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained throughout

## Input Format
- Content to check (text, code, diagram, exercise, etc.)
- Reference standards (existing terminology list, style guide, etc.)
- Specific areas to focus on (terminology, notation, formatting, etc.)
- Module or section context

## Output Format
- List of consistency issues found
- Specific locations of inconsistencies
- Recommended corrections
- Severity level (critical/high/medium/low)
- Suggested standard to follow
- Links to relevant style guides or standards

## Consistency Areas to Check
- Terminology: Ensure the same concept is referred to consistently
- Notation: Verify mathematical symbols and programming conventions
- Formatting: Check headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
- Style: Maintain consistent tone and technical depth
- Cross-references: Ensure internal links and references are consistent
- Visual elements: Verify consistent diagram styles and color schemes
- Code examples: Ensure consistent programming conventions

## Quality Standards
- Maintain academic rigor throughout the textbook
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Follow consistent pedagogical approach
- Maintain technical accuracy
- Ensure visual consistency
- Verify cross-reference integrity
- Confirm consistent citation style

## Automated Checks
- Terminology database matching
- Notation pattern recognition
- Formatting rule validation
- Cross-reference verification
- Accessibility checklist validation
- Style guide compliance checking

## Manual Verification Areas
- Complex conceptual consistency
- Context-appropriate terminology
- Pedagogical effectiveness
- Technical accuracy verification
- Subjective style decisions
