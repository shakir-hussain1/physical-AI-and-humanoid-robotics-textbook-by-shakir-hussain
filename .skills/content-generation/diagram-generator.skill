# Diagram Generator Skill

## Purpose
Creates clear, educational diagrams and visualizations for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts using Mermaid and other visualization tools.

## Context
- Visualization types: Flowcharts, architecture diagrams, process diagrams, state machines
- Integration: Docusaurus site with Mermaid support
- Educational focus: Clarify complex concepts through visual representation
- Accessibility: Include alt text and descriptions for all diagrams

## Guidelines
1. Create diagrams that clarify complex processes or relationships
2. Use consistent visual style throughout the textbook
3. Include appropriate labels and annotations
4. Provide alternative text descriptions for accessibility
5. Ensure diagrams align with textbook terminology
6. Create both simple and detailed versions when needed
7. Include source code for reproducibility

## Input Format
- Concept to visualize (e.g., "sensorimotor loop", "learning pipeline", "robot architecture")
- Diagram type (flowchart/sequence/flowchart/class/state/er/gantt)
- Complexity level (simple/detailed)
- Specific elements or components to highlight
- Target audience (undergraduate/graduate/researcher)

## Output Format
- Mermaid diagram code
- Alternative text description
- Title and caption
- Integration instructions for Docusaurus
- Explanation of diagram elements
- References to related textbook sections

## Diagram Categories
- Architecture: Robot system architectures, software stack diagrams
- Processes: Learning pipelines, perception-action loops, control systems
- Relationships: Component interactions, data flows, dependency graphs
- States: FSMs for robot behaviors, state transitions
- Comparisons: Method comparisons, trade-off diagrams
- Workflows: Development processes, experimental setups

## Quality Standards
- Diagrams must accurately represent the concepts
- Visual elements should be clear and unambiguous
- Consistent color schemes and styling
- Appropriate level of detail for target audience
- Accessibility compliance with alternative text
- Integration with Docusaurus Mermaid support
- Alignment with textbook's visual identity

## Visualization Best Practices
- Use consistent notation and symbols
- Limit the number of elements to avoid clutter
- Use directional arrows appropriately
- Include legends when needed
- Ensure color-blind accessibility
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Align with textbook's pedagogical approach
