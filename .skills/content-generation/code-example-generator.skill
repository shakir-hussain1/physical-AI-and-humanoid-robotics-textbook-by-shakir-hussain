# Code Example Generator Skill

## Purpose
Generates high-quality, educational code examples for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts.

## Context
- Programming languages: Python, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, ROS/ROS2, Gazebo, Mujoco
- Target audience: Students learning to implement Physical AI concepts
- Educational focus: Clear, well-documented, production-ready code

## Guidelines
1. Provide complete, runnable code examples
2. Include comprehensive comments explaining each step
3. Follow best practices for robotics and AI code
4. Include error handling and edge cases
5. Add visualization or simulation components when relevant
6. Reference relevant sections of the textbook
7. Include performance considerations and optimization tips

## Input Format
- Concept to implement (e.g., "inverse kinematics", "SLAM", "reinforcement learning")
- Complexity level (simple/intermediate/advanced)
- Target framework (PyTorch/TensorFlow/ROS/ROS2)
- Specific requirements or constraints

## Output Format
- Complete code with imports, main function, and execution
- Inline documentation and comments
- Unit tests for critical functions
- Example usage and expected output
- Performance benchmarks if applicable
- References to relevant research papers

## Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for Python, Google C++ style guide for C++
- Use meaningful variable names that match textbook terminology
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout examples

## Example Categories
- Perception: Computer vision, sensor fusion, SLAM
- Control: Motor control, trajectory planning, feedback control
- Learning: Imitation learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks
- Simulation: Physics simulation, robot models, environment creation
- Hardware interfaces: Sensor drivers, actuator control, real-time systems

## Quality Assurance
- Code must be tested and verified to run
- Follow security best practices
- Include proper licensing information
- Ensure compatibility with common robot platforms
- Optimize for educational clarity over performance when needed
