# Exercise Creator Skill

## Purpose
Creates educational exercises and problems for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook modules.

## Context
- Educational levels: Undergraduate, graduate, researcher
- Exercise types: Theoretical, computational, implementation, research-oriented
- Integration: Links to textbook concepts and provides progressive difficulty
- Assessment: Clear evaluation criteria and expected outcomes

## Guidelines
1. Create exercises that reinforce key concepts from the textbook
2. Provide multiple difficulty levels within each module
3. Include both theoretical and practical components
4. Suggest tools, datasets, or simulation environments for implementation
5. Provide hints and guidance for complex problems
6. Include evaluation criteria and expected outcomes
7. Link exercises to real-world applications in humanoid robotics
