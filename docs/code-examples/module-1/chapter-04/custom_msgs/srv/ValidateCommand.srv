# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook
# Module 1, Chapter 4: Command Validation Service
# Description: Service to validate commands before execution
# Usage: Safety check before dispatching commands to robot controllers

# ==================== Request ====================
# Command to validate
AICommand command          # The command to validate

# Validation context
RobotState current_state   # Current robot state for context
bool check_safety          # Perform safety validation
bool check_feasibility     # Check if physically possible
bool check_collision       # Run collision detection

---
# ==================== Response ====================
# Overall result
bool is_valid              # Whether command is valid and safe
string[] warnings          # Non-blocking warnings
string[] errors            # Blocking errors that prevent execution

# Detailed validation results
bool safety_passed         # Safety checks passed
bool feasibility_passed    # Feasibility checks passed
bool collision_free        # No predicted collisions

# Suggested modifications
AICommand suggested_command  # Modified command if original invalid
bool has_suggestion        # Whether a suggestion is provided

# Risk assessment
float32 risk_score         # Overall risk score [0.0, 1.0]
string[] risk_factors      # Identified risk factors
