# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World - Project Constitution

## Version
**Constitution Version:** 1.1.0
**Ratification Date:** 2025-12-16
**Last Amended Date:** 2025-12-16

## Mission
To create a comprehensive, authoritative, and accessible textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics that serves students, researchers, and practitioners by providing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations across six core modules: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence, The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), The Digital Twin, The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac), Vision-Language-Action (VLA), and a Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Robot project.

## Principles

### PRINCIPLE_1: Technical Excellence and Accuracy
All content must meet the highest standards of technical accuracy in Physical AI, robotics, and humanoid systems. This includes mathematical correctness, implementation feasibility using ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, and Unity, and alignment with peer-reviewed research. All AI-generated content must undergo rigorous technical validation before inclusion.

### PRINCIPLE_2: Educational Pedagogy
Content must follow evidence-based educational practices including appropriate difficulty progression across the six core modules, clear learning objectives for each module, and multiple modalities for different learning styles. AI-assisted content generation must enhance, not replace, pedagogical effectiveness with hands-on implementation focus.

### PRINCIPLE_3: Accessibility and Inclusion
All materials must be accessible to diverse learners, including those with disabilities. This encompasses WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for digital content, inclusive language, and multiple pathways for different backgrounds and learning preferences. Content must be accessible to both beginners and advanced robotics practitioners.

### PRINCIPLE_4: Practical Application
The textbook must bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementation using real-world tools and frameworks: ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services, actions, rclpy), URDF for humanoid robots, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, and Vision-Language-Action systems. Each module must include hands-on exercises and projects.

### PRINCIPLE_5: Ethical Responsibility
All content must consider the ethical implications of humanoid robotics and AI, including safety in physical systems, privacy in perception systems, societal impact of autonomous robots, and responsible development practices. AI-assisted content generation must reflect these ethical considerations, especially for autonomous humanoid systems.

### PRINCIPLE_6: Collaborative Intelligence
The project embraces human-AI collaboration, where AI tools enhance human creativity and expertise rather than replace it. Claude Code subagents and skills must augment human authorship while maintaining human oversight, particularly for complex technical content involving ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and humanoid robotics implementations.

### PRINCIPLE_7: Module-Based Structure
Content must be organized around the six core modules with clear progression from Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence through to the Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Robot project. Each module must build upon previous modules while maintaining conceptual coherence and technical continuity.

### PRINCIPLE_8: Citation and Reference Standards
All content must include proper academic citations and references. The book must conclude with a comprehensive reference list that includes peer-reviewed papers, technical documentation, API references, and authoritative sources for all tools and frameworks covered (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo, Unity, etc.).

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Changes to this constitution require:
1. Proposal with rationale documented in a Prompt History Record (PHR)
2. Review by project maintainers
3. Consensus approval for minor changes or majority for major changes
4. Update to all dependent artifacts as per consistency requirements

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Changes to fundamental principles, mission, or core module structure
- MINOR: Addition of new governance mechanisms, principle expansions, or module additions
- PATCH: Clarifications, corrections, or non-semantic improvements

### Compliance Review
Quarterly reviews ensure project activities align with constitutional principles, with special attention to:
- Module progression and technical continuity
- Implementation of ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and other core frameworks
- Citation and reference accuracy
- AI-assisted content quality and educational effectiveness

## AI-Assisted Development Framework

### Human-in-the-Loop Requirements
- All AI-generated content requires human review and approval by robotics domain experts
- Technical validation must be performed by practitioners experienced with ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and humanoid robotics
- Pedagogical effectiveness must be verified by education specialists familiar with robotics curriculum

### Quality Assurance Protocols
- Automated consistency checking using Claude Code subagents
- Technical validation through multiple verification methods including simulation and implementation testing
- Accessibility review for all generated content
- Module coherence validation to ensure progression from basic concepts to capstone project

### Skill and Subagent Governance
- All Claude Code skills must align with constitutional principles and module-based structure
- Regular auditing of AI-generated content quality with focus on technical accuracy
- Continuous improvement of subagent performance and accuracy for robotics-specific content
- Specialized validation for code examples, URDF files, simulation environments, and AI pipelines
